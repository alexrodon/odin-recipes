    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of past. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle
        or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets
        with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5><strong>For the meat sauce:</strong></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatos</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><strong>To assemble the lasagna:</strong></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375º. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta 
            according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and
            drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef 
            until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and 
            drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, 
            stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and 
            stir until warmed through. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl 
            and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across 
            the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a 
            layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat 
            sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, 
            Parmesan, and mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400º 
            and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish with parsley before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
